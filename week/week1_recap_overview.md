### Most Dramatic Comebacks:

**Biggest Comeback:**
- **MEM vs. MIA**: Overcame a **45-point deficit** - the largest comeback of the week
  - Despite the massive comeback effort, finished with a 32-point final margin
  - This represents one of the most remarkable in-game turnarounds

**Top 5 Comebacks:**
1. **MEM vs. MIA**: 45-point deficit overcome
2. **DAL vs. SAS**: 33-point deficit overcome (final margin: 33 pts)
3. **ATL vs. TOR**: 29-point deficit overcome (final margin: 20 pts)
4. **WAS vs. CHA**: 28-point deficit overcome (final margin: 2 pts) - most successful comeback
5. **CLE @ BKN**: 25-point deficit overcome (final margin: 7 pts)

**Key Observations:**
- **Only 1 out of 10 top comebacks resulted in a victory** for the team making the comeback
- This suggests that while teams were able to mount significant rallies, they often fell short of complete comebacks
- The relationship between comeback magnitude and final outcome shows that larger deficits, even when overcome, often still resulted in losses
- Close games (≤5 pts) provided more opportunities for successful comebacks

**Comeback Success Rate:**
- **Successful Comeback Wins: 1 game (10%)**
- **Comeback but Lost: 9 games (90%)**
- This pattern indicates that while dramatic rallies occurred, the teams making comebacks often couldn't sustain momentum to secure victories
